# Gotchas — the invariant ledger

> **RULE: before modifying ANY subsystem, grep this file for it and read the matching
> entries.** These are load-bearing invariants — most were written after something broke
> on a live node, and many end with an explicit "don't do X" that a future change would
> otherwise walk straight into.
>
> **A newly discovered gotcha goes HERE**, not in CLAUDE.md. Docs travel with code —
> update this file in the same PR as the change that discovered or altered an invariant.
>
> Format: one bullet, **bold lead naming the invariant**, then the story, ending with the
> explicit don't. Cross-project version drift lives in
> `~/Projects/Launchpad-RS/docs/sharp-edges.md` instead.

<!-- Empty at bootstrap. It fills up. That's the point — every entry here is a bug
     that will now never happen twice. -->
